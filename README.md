# AI Workflows & Agent Orchestration

This repository contains practical AI automation workflows focused on
LLM-based agents, decision orchestration, and real-world integrations.

The main goal is to explore how autonomous or semi-autonomous agents can be
designed, constrained, and deployed using workflow-based systems such as n8n.

---

## Scope

- AI agents built on top of LLM APIs
- Workflow orchestration with n8n
- Tool-based agent execution (APIs, databases, services)
- Prompt design and decision control
- Practical automation use cases

---

## Architecture Overview

Typical workflow structure:

1. **Trigger**
   - Webhook, scheduled job, or external event
2. **Pre-processing**
   - Input normalization and validation
3. **AI Agent**
   - Decision-making using an LLM
   - Tool selection and parameter generation
4. **Tools**
   - HTTP APIs, databases, SaaS integrations
5. **Post-processing**
   - Validation, logging, and output formatting
